    "So far we have covered the history of deep architectures for image classification tasks, how neural architectures can be designed. We learned about how classification losses can be derived and understood and how in Similarity Learning, the objective is framed differently, in that we want to push related feature embeddings closer together and (supposedly) unrelated embeddings further apart. We went on to learn about how the task of Object Detection can be framed. \n",

    "- In HDR (High Dynamic Range) photography, we're interested in increasing the dynamic range (i.e. the brightness steps) of an image by combining multiple images taken with a different aperture. Details that are blown out due to overexposure in one image can be exposed just correctly in another image. Combining these images can help having an equal amount of detail in shadows as well as close to light sources and reflections. To utilize this idea, the images must first be aligned, because we don't usually have a static scene and camera.\n",

    "Imagine yourself with two images each taken from a different perspective. One of them lays infront of you on a table the other one you hold with both of your hands. Lets also say that the image in your hands is somewhat transparent to make it easier. How would you align the image in your hands to the image on the table?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you might do is move the image roughly above the image on the table so that their positions somewhat match up.<br>\n",
    "If we abstract our image into the realm of mathematics then we can think of the image as in a 2d space<br>\n",
    "and we can interpret its movement as a shift along the x or y-axis. <br>\n",
    "To achieve these kind of shifts we shift the whole 2d space and with it will go the image as a subset of this space. To transform our 2d space in general we can use our favourite thing, matrices.<br>\n",
    "If you are unsure about why matrices represent transformations we recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE). <br>\n",
    "The thing is that matrices will only transform our space linearly, meaning the origin will stay fixed and parallel lines will remain parallel. Parallel lines staying parallel sounds good, but to achieve a shift we will also have to move the origin.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "If we also want to mathematically express tilts without bothering with any more complex transformations we can just switch to 3 dimensions. In 3d a tilt is nothing but a rotation. <br>\n",
    "Going 3d has another benefit. If you look at top side of the sheared square you can see how it is shifting. So what what if we shear a cube in 3d and imagine the top side as our image ... *drumroll*... We just shifted/translated our image with a **linear** transformation without having to add any vector.\n",

    "# Approach 1: Estimating the Transformation Matrix\n",

    "\n",
    "The prediction is based on image coordinates of the points in a transformed view or perspective.<br>\n",
    "Note that we dont give the network any information about the original view of our planar object. If you are now wondering how the network would then be able to predict the affine transformation that would align two yet unseen images, then you are right to wonder, because in this approach we always train with the same original image that is then transformed into many new views from which the network has to predict the respective transformations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the network should be able to generalize, that is predict the parameters of the transformation for an image in an unknown view.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure\n",
    "The first thing we do is choose a model, but not model as in neural network but as in mould or object.\n",
    "This model represents our original image from which we generate new views.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/models.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\" style=\"padding-top:15px\"/>\n",

    "Before we generate new views based on affine transformations we define the possible ranges of values for the parameters that constitute the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step we sample affine transformations according to the previously defined parameter ranges. These transformations will then be applied to the known view, our original image or model. The result are transformed views which are then used to train the Single Layer Neural Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is not the transformed images themselves but coordinates of points in the transformed images. Points like the *int_points* in the illustration above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss is calculated based on the predicted and true parameters using the sum of squared errors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One important detail about the architecture is that they split the coordinates of the transformed points into x and y values which reduced the time to generate the transformed views significantly and also reduced the network size by half. *(This was in 1999, when hardware limitation were still a concern)*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing\n",
    "To test the models performance they compared the outputed transformation parameters directly to the true parameters and also compared the original image with the true transformation applied to the original image with the predicted transformation applied.\n",
